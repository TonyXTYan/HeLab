# Known issues

Bugs, gaps and flaky tests, open and recently fixed. Moved here from the
[roadmap overview](_readme.md) on 2026-10-21 (Tony). Features and their priorities stay in
the overview; manual checks stay in [.ai/MANUAL_TODO.md](../.ai/MANUAL_TODO.md).

How to use it:

- Add an item with the date found (YYYY-MM-DD), where it shows (OS, CI or a lab PC) and
  what is known of its cause. Link evidence in `.ai/sessions/`.
- A test that needed a `RERUN` is an item until its cause is found. "Flaky" is not a cause.
- When an item is fixed, tick it, add the commit and move it to **Fixed**. Drop fixed
  items at the next release's tidy-up.

## App

- [ ] Folders with over 100,000 entries record a scan failure.
- [ ] The temp folder (`DIR_TEMPS`, Settings → General) is created and can be
  changed, but nothing uses it: helpers' private folders go to the system temp
  dir (`tempfile.mkdtemp` in `IOService`). Remove the setting, or move helper
  folders into it (2026-10-15).
- [ ] SMB audit leftovers (2026-10-20): a Windows-suited "seen twice" interval
  (Windows caches attributes 10 s); details scans for visible rows only; icons kept
  across Refresh; the startup "database is locked" on a fresh store; refuse a
  network or synced temp folder at startup, as the cache folder is.
- [ ] With the default of one background lane, folder details and status checks
  (including manual ones) wait for the selected load. As planned; revisit if
  it feels slow.
- [ ] When a tab's shown data is dropped while it is shown (a folder status check finds
  the folder mismatched, or its cache is cleared), the tab keeps its arrays and later
  plots on screen; a load finding missing shots clears them (Tony, 2026-10-14). Since
  plotting, a plot whose folder signature no longer matches says "Showing previously loaded
  data" (`_update_plot_source_label`); not checked: a cache clear, which keeps the signature,
  and the tab's own arrays (2026-10-28).
- [ ] With a server clock more than 2 s off ours, a change in the same mtime step right after a
  listing (FAT and some shares keep 2 s) isn't seen by the quick check until the folder's next
  change (the next shot) or a Retry / Refresh (R-1's residual, agreed with the reviewer)
  (2026-10-22).
- [ ] An identity probe (`cache_admin identity`) waits its turn in the local lane (2 processes).
  Behind long local work it starts late, and only its no-progress timeout is capped, so quitting
  waits that long (Quit now skips it) (Result Cache R2, 2026-10-23).
- [ ] Mixed versions: an older HeLab's Clear all and root clear don't remove saved listings or
  bump `gen_listings`, and its re-key leaves them at the old key; the next listing re-saves them,
  so harmless (cache-only, 2026-10-26).
- [ ] Windows cache moves on a venv install (unsure, not seen): a venv's `python.exe` is a
  redirector that runs the real interpreter as a child; killing it (`_reap`) ends the child only
  through its job object, so the child may hold files a moment after `wait()` returns, and a move's
  rename could hit WinError 32 now and then (lab PCs, CI). The move's verify and recovery catch it,
  but the user sees a failed move. Frozen builds don't have this (Codebase Review 2, 2026-10-26).

- [ ] From the computer-use smoke pass on Tony's Mac (built app at `41a6a7d`, 2026-10-28;
  [results](../.ai/sessions/2026-10-28-claude-smoke-mac/results.md)):
  - HeLab exited without a crash report while loading 20260727-RingBEC (1,007 TXY, 22.5 M
    rows) from the share, at about 14:04–14:06 (pid 79750). Its log is on that Mac,
    `~/Library/Caches/HeLab/logs/helab-79750.log` (last line "Disk cache cleanup" at 14:04:22);
    the retry loaded fine. Cause unknown.
  - Release time took 932.8 s on that folder (35 s on a 519-shot folder), and the process
    reached ~7.3 GB RSS with Velocity distributions running beside it. It needs progress or an
    ETA, or a cap on the bootstrap for big folders.
  - File › Quit sometimes left the process running, so two instances ran at once. It was seen
    when the click landed before the menu opened; cause unknown.
  - In the plot settings panel, Return doesn't commit a typed value (the editor stays open);
    Tab does.
  - A plot tab's "x" didn't respond to computer-use clicks (the dock title's "x" did). It may
    be only an accessibility gap.
  - Saving an arrangement preset kept plot 19's unsaved Log Y. Possibly intended; Tony to judge.

## Tests and CI

- [ ] `test_preset_folder_live.py::test_offline_a_folder_never_listed_is_named_as_such` reran once
  on Windows CI (2026-10-29, run 40713926667, `09a0711` on `agent/txy-reference`): `pytestqt.exceptions.TimeoutError:
  waitUntil timed out in 30000 milliseconds` (line 82); passed on its retry. The branch doesn't touch
  the test or the code it exercises; cause not found yet.
- [ ] A test that closes a real main window leaves the app-wide IOService closed in
  `io_service._service`, its retired requests never forgotten (timer stopped), until the next
  `get_io_service()` replaces it; and a live app-wide service (and its FolderCache) lasts the
  worker's run, so its timers and helpers can work against later tests' private stores. Tests
  should start each with a fresh or quiesced app-wide service, but a closed one must not simply be
  reset: wait for its old helpers' exits first (`cache_busy()`), or their store may still be open
  (found by `agent/quick-fixes-3`, Feeler's review, 2026-10-27).
- [ ] `test_folder_summary.py::test_disk_cache_summary_tracks_shared_save_completion[cache_saved]`
  reran once on macOS CI (2026-10-26, run 40279097363, `276e571`): `assert 'Cached data loaded ·
  Cached just now · Freshness unknown' == 'Cached data loaded · Cached just now'` (line 413). Likely
  a timing race: the second tab's row has no folder modified time yet when the save completes, so
  its freshness is unknown. Passed on its retry and in 12 local runs (Cache Only handoff).
  Reran 3× on macOS CI on 2026-10-28 (run 40679555921, job 122786573479, `7b82c9d`; below), so
  it is not a one-off.
- [ ] macOS CI on `dev/v0.0.7` (run 40679555921, job 122786573479, `7b82c9d`, 2026-10-28) was
  cancelled at ~20 min (earlier macOS jobs took 5–6 min):
  `test_correlations.py::test_fifty_shots_of_two_thousand_events_take_seconds` reran 5× then
  failed; `test_folder_summary.py::test_disk_cache_summary_tracks_shared_save_completion[cache_saved]`
  reran 3×; `test_correlations_plot.py::test_back_to_back_pairs_peak_at_zero_with_the_trap_origin`
  and `test_analysis_gui.py::test_another_library_draws_the_plot_again_without_a_rerun` reran once
  each. Four "Timeout (0:01:40)!" dumps (one in `test_g2_zero_error_matches_its_scatter`) and
  crashed workers gw0 and gw1. The same tree (`e75a105`) passed every job in run 40679110506
  minutes earlier, so a slow runner with timing-sensitive, compute-heavy tests is likely; cause
  not found.
- [ ] `test_live_plots.py::test_a_floating_plot_runs_and_follows_with_its_settings_in_its_window`
  reran once on macOS CI (run 40260284152): `'completed' == 'cancelled'`. Cause unknown
  ([audit](../.ai/sessions/2026-10-28-claude-v0.0.6-checks/audit.md) #23, 2026-10-28).
- [ ] `test_analysis_gui.py::test_scatter_from_the_panel` (a Dash/web-view plot) reran in local
  full runs on 2026-10-20 (`dld-d7` and `refactor-prep` handoffs); it passed on retry and alone.
  Cause unknown (audit #16, 2026-10-28).
- [ ] `test_plot_settings_panel.py::test_activation_sources` reran once on macOS CI; it didn't
  fail in 60 local runs under load (2026-10-21). The Windows rerun was the web-view crash
  (fixed); the macOS rerun (`f9faefd`) was a teardown failure, cause unknown, and 160 local
  runs passed. CI now prints rerun reasons: read them at its next rerun (2026-10-22). No rerun
  in the 23 CI runs to 2026-10-23; a frameless Qt exception there now names where the event
  loop ran (`e326fdf`).
  No rerun in the 36 test jobs since 2026-10-23 (Quick Fixes 2). Its macOS teardown failure
  (`f9faefd`) may have been the same message-handler race as the scatter test's, which
  `--no-qt-log` removes (`cd2b0c3`); keep it open a while longer.

Tony (2026-10-22): note these, no fixes for now; raise them again only if they keep
happening. Counted over the last 12 CI runs from `gh api repos/TonyXTYan/HeLab/actions/jobs/<id>/logs`
(whose Windows logs include the test output; `gh run view --log` can return nothing). The Quick
Fixes floor (2026-10-23) fixed four (dropped from Fixed at the v0.0.6a1 tidy-up). A "worker
crashed" on CI with no traceback is usually CI's 120 s timeout, whose stacks
`faulthandler_timeout` now prints.

## Fixed

Landed in `dev/v0.0.7`:

- [x] The release job left v0.0.6a1's draft with no assets (run 40675311830 on `main`, "Tag
  tested main commit and create draft release": "Draft was replaced, removed or published;
  refusing to modify it"). GitHub lists a draft under `untagged-<hash>`, so the lookup by tag
  missed it; v0.0.5a1's draft is empty the same way. The lookup also matches the draft's name
  now (`d36a20e`, not yet on `main`). The v0.0.6a1 draft is still empty (2026-10-28).
